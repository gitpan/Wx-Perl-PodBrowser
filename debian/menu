# Menu policy is in /usr/share/doc/menu/menu.txt.gz
# Menu files are in /usr/share/menu (previously /usr/lib/menu).
# Part "3.5. The `section' field" has the possible menu sections.
#
# section="Help" would be another possibility.  Think that's meant for
# user documentation rather than programming things.
